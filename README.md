## 📖 Introduction

SK-RD4AD (Skip-Connected Reverse Distillation for Anomaly Detection) introduces a novel and effective architecture for one-class anomaly detection. By leveraging non-corresponding skip connections within a reverse knowledge distillation framework, SK-RD4AD effectively mitigates deep feature degradation, a common issue in traditional distillation-based methods. This enhancement significantly improves both pixel-level anomaly localization and image-level detection across various industrial domains.

## 🔥 Key Highlights
- 🔗 **Non-Corresponding Skip Connections**  
  Enhances multi-scale feature propagation between encoder and decoder, allowing both low-level textures and high-level semantics to be preserved.

- 🚀 **State-of-the-Art Performance**  
  Surpasses RD4AD on **MVTec-AD**, **VisA**, and **VAD** by up to **+3.5% AUROC**, **+21% AUPRO**, and excels in challenging categories like **Transistor**.

- 🌐 **Generalization Power**  
  Effectively handles diverse anomaly types and generalizes to **real-world datasets** such as **automotive VAD** and **industrial VisA**.

- ⚙️ **Efficient Architecture**  
  Lightweight decoder with modest memory (401MB) and inference time (0.37s), making it suitable for **edge and cloud** deployment.

## 📂 Model Overview
SK-RD4AD enhances the original RD4AD framework by addressing deep-layer information loss. It introduces strategically designed non-corresponding skip connections that allow features from shallower teacher layers to influence deeper student layers. This architecture improves the decoder’s capacity to reconstruct complex features and leads to significantly better anomaly localization performance.

## ⚙️ Experiment Settings

### 🧪 Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📁 Dataset Preparation
Download the MVTec, VAD and VisA datasets from:
- [MVTec AD Dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/)
- [Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LbHHJHCdkvhzVqekAIRdWjBWaBHxPjuu/view/)

### 🏃 Train and Test the Model
To train and evaluate the model, use the appropriate script depending on the dataset.

The following command is for training and evaluating the model on **MVTec-AD** :
```bash
python main.py \
    --epochs 200 \
    --res 3 \
    --learning_rate 0.005 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --seed 111 \
    --class all \
    --seg 1 \
    --print_epoch 10 \
    --data_path /home/user/mvtec/ \
    --save_path /home/user/anomaly_checkpoints/skipconnection/ \
    --print_loss 1 \
    --net wide_res50 \
    --L2 0
```
> For **VisA** or **VAD**, use `main_visa.py` or `main_vad.py`.

## 📈 Performance Highlights
